# Classification
> In this module, you will learn about classification technique. You practice with different classification algorithms, such as KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and SVM. Also, you learn about pros and cons of each method, and different classification accuracy metrics.
# Learning Objectives
- Compare and contrast the characteristics of different Classification methods.
- Explain how to apply the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- Describe model evaluation metrics.
- Describe how a decision tree works.
- Outline how to build a decision tree.
- Apply Classification algorithms on various datasets to solve real world problems.
- Describe how regression trees are built and how to use them.
