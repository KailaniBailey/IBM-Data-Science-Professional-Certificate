# From Deployment to Feedback and Final Evaluation
> When you complete this module, you’ll be able to describe the deployment and feedback stages of the data science methodology. You’ll learn how to assess a data model’s performance, impact, and readiness. You’ll be able to identify the stakeholders who usually contribute to model refinement. You’ll also be able to explain why deployment and feedback should be an iterative process. To complete your hands-on lab experience, you’ll devise a business problem to solve using data related to email, hospitals, or credit cards. You’ll demonstrate your understanding of data science methodology by applying it to a given problem. You’ll construct responses that address each phase of the CRISP-DM based on a chosen business problem. After submitting your work, you’ll evaluate your peers’ final projects and provide constructive ideas and suggestions that fellow learners can apply right away.
