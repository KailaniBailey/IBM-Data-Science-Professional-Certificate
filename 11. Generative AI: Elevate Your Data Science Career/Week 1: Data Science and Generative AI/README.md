# Data Science and Generative AI
> In this module, you will explore the role of generative AI in data science. Lesson 1 introduces you to generative AI and how it can serve various purposes in the hands of data scientists. You will learn about the four common types of generative AI models and their impact and applications across diverse industries. Lesson 2 will cover how data scientists can leverage generative AI in the data science lifecycle. You will learn how data scientists can effectively use generative AI to perform data generation, data preparation, data querying, and data augmentation. You will also learn about data preparation and querying challenges and how generative AI models can help tackle these challenges.
